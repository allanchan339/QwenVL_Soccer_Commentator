# Performance Optimization Guidelines

- Use async/await for I/O-bound concurrency.
- Apply functools.lru_cache, @cache, or fastapi.Depends caching where appropriate.
- Use psutil or similar for resource monitoring.
- Release unused resources to prevent memory leaks.
- Use concurrent.futures or asyncio for concurrency.
- Design efficient DB schemas, optimize queries, and use indexes wisely.
